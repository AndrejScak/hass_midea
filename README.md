## No more development
Unfortunately I do not have access to my Midea Air Conditioners as I have relocated to a new house. This means that I cannot reliably support this library due to not being able to test it with real hardware anymore.

# midea-ac-py 

This is a library to allow communicating to a Midea AC via the Midea Cloud.

This is a very early release, and comes without any guarantees. This is still an early work in progress and simply serves as a proof of concept.

This library would not have been possible if it wasn't for the amazing work done by @yitsushi and his Ruby based command line tool. 
You can find his work here: https://github.com/yitsushi/midea-air-condition
The reasons for me converting this to Python is that this library also serves as a platform component for Home Assistant.
